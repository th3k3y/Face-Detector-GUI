# Face Detection GUI

This is a simple GUI application that allows the user to import an image and analyze whether it contains a face or not. The application is built using the tkinter library for the graphical user interface and the OpenCV library for face detection.

## Installation

To run the application, you will need to install the following libraries:

- tkinter
- opencv-python

You can install these libraries using pip:

pip install tkinter opencv-python

## Usage

To start the application, run the following command:

python Detector.py

The application window will appear, allowing you to import an image by clicking on the "Import Image" button. Once you have imported an image, you can click on the "Analyze" button to analyze the image for the presence of a face. If a face is detected, the image will be displayed on the canvas with the face centered. If a face is not detected, a message will be displayed indicating that no face was found.
